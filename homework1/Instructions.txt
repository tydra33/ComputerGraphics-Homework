The application works by allowing the user to input vectors in the input box. Once the user has typed the input, they press the "Transform List of Vectors" button,
which performs the following transformations to the inputted vectors:

translation along the x-axis by 1.25
rotation around the z-axis by an angle pi / 3
translation along the z axis by 4.15
translation along the y - axis by 3.14
scalation along the x and y axes by 1.12
rotation around the y-axis by an angle of 5 * pi / 8

When the button is pressed the translated vectors will be written in the output field (under "Transformed points: ").
